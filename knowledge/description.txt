Observe Lite â€” Product Overview

Purpose
Observe Lite lets teams visualize service metrics on dashboards. Each org has projects, projects have dashboards, and dashboards show widgets bound to metrics. This document explains intended behavior so a reader can tell if a customer report is a bug, intended behavior, or a request that already exists.

Entities
- Org: top level account. Must be active.
- User: belongs to one org, has a role, has active flag.
- Project: lives under an org. visibility is "private" or "public". Projects can be active or inactive.
- Permission: grants a user access to a private project with scopes like viewer or editor.
- Dashboard: belongs to a project. Can be active or inactive.
- Widget: a chart that binds to a metric via metric_id and can have filters. Visibility is controlled by visible and archived flags.
- Metric: time series identified by metric_id with a status and retention_days.
- Metric samples: sparse daily entries that represent recent data for a metric.

Visibility and access rules
- Users must be active to see private content.
- Public projects are visible to any user in the same org.
- Private projects require a permission row for the user with at least viewer.
- Viewers can see dashboards and widgets. Editors can change dashboard layout and widget settings.

Dashboard and widget behavior
- A widget will not show up if visible=false or archived=true.
- A widget can show an empty chart when filters exclude all data or when the metric has no recent samples.
- Widget titles are human labels and may not match metric names.

Metrics and freshness
- A metric is considered fresh when there is at least one metric_samples entry in the last 1 to 2 days.
- retention_days limits how far back charts can display. Older points can drop off by design.
- If a metric has no recent samples, the widget may appear empty. This is intended, not a rendering bug.

Examples of intended outcomes
- Inactive user cannot access a private project or its dashboards.
- A user without a permission row for a private project cannot see it, even if they know the name.
- A hidden or archived widget does not appear on the dashboard.
- A widget can look empty if the metric has no recent samples or if filters are too narrow.
- Charts will not show data older than retention_days.

What customers can do today
- Create dashboards, add or remove widgets, and set widget visibility.
- Bind a widget to any existing metric in the same project.
- Configure filters like env and region on the widget.
- Grant viewer or editor access to private projects via permissions.

Notes on identifiers
- Projects and dashboards are human names.
- Metrics use ids like m_latency or m_error_rate.
- Users are identified by email and belong to exactly one org.
